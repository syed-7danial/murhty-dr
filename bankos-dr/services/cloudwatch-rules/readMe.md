# Cloudwatch Rules Switching
## Overview
This script (main.js) is designed to automate the switching of AWS Cloudwatch rules between Active and Failover environments.

It ensures that during a failover event or environment restoration, Cloudwatch rules are enabled or disabled in the appropriate regions to control event flow correctly.

The script also supports:

 Dry-run mode for safe simulations.
Option to process the current environment, both dynamically controlled via the Jenkins pipeline (Jenkinsfile).
## How It Works
1. Configuration Check
Before execution, run-eventbridge.js performs the following checks:

### DRY_RUN Mode:
Determines whether to simulate actions without applying real changes.

### Process Current Environment:
Specifies whether to disable rules in the currently active region when switching to another environment.

Both options are dynamically injected by Jenkins at runtime to ensure environment-specific control and safety.

## Switching Logic
### Switching from Active to Failover Region
When switching from Active to Failover, the following steps occur:

The script reads a common configuration file to obtain:

List of Cloudwatch rules in both Active and Failover regions.
### Actions performed:
List all EventBridge event buses and rules in the Failover region.

Enable all relevant Cloudwatch rules in the Failover region.

If --processCurrentEnvironment is enabled, disable all relevant Cloudwatch rules in the Active region.
AWS-managed rules are skipped to prevent unintended modifications.

This ensures that:

Failover region Cloudwatch rules are active and ready to handle events.

Active region Cloudwatch rules are disabled, preventing duplicate or conflicting event processing.

### Note:
Only Cloudwatch rules listed in the configuration are affected.

Other AWS-managed or unrelated rules remain untouched.

## Switching from Failover to Active Region
When switching from Failover back to Active, the following steps occur:

The script reads the same common configuration file to obtain:

List of Cloudwatch rules in both Failover and Active regions.

### Actions performed:
List all EventBridge event buses and rules in the Active region.

Enable all relevant Cloudwatch rules in the Active region.

If --processCurrentEnvironment is enabled, disable all relevant Cloudwatch rules in the Failover region.

AWS-managed rules are skipped to avoid errors.

This ensures that:

Active region Cloudwatch rules are enabled and handling events.

Failover region Cloudwatch rules are disabled to prevent conflicts.

### Note:
Only Cloudwatch rules specified in the configuration are modified.

All other rules, including AWS-managed, remain unaffected.



### Important Notes
#### DRY_RUN Mode:
When enabled, all actions are logged but no real changes are applied to Cloudwatch rules — useful for validation and testing.
#### Process Current Environment:
When enabled, the script disables rules in the currently active environment, ensuring a complete switch without conflicts.
#### Targeted Modifications:
Only Cloudwatch rules specified in the configuration file are affected.
AWS-managed rules are automatically skipped to prevent accidental modification of system rules.
#### Process Common Config
Includes the common folder client for configuration, otherwise the jenkins pipeline would not handle any clients.
